       In the summer, the University of Michigan Women in Science and Engineering group holds a 
        camp for girls interested in STEM fields. There are many different subjects that students
        may go into, such as chemistry, engineering survey, human genetics, and physics. The students
        participate in labs, experiments, learn their way around the U of M campus, and much more. 
        They also learn about different scientific disciplines, like the scientific method, and build
        a community within their group.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I attended the WISE GISE Summer Camp in 2018, between 7th and 8th grade. I had heard about it
        from a student in the year above me at school who said that the chemistry portion had helped 
        her with the content that they covered in 8th grade, so I decided to apply. I was in the 
        Chemistry Blue group (there were two chemistry groups), and we focused on studying organic
        chemistry. I remember greatly enjoying the experiments we did, especially the ones involving 
        acid/base reactions. While I did learn information that helped me with my chemistry class the 
        following year, I also learned a lot more about what scientists do and the many facets that 
        one subject in science can have. Before this camp, I didn't have a lot of experience in 
        applications of science, and it helped to foster my interest in science and other science
        camps like <a href="MMSS.html">MMSS</a>.
