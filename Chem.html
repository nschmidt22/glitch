      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       One of the many clubs that our school has is Chemistry Club. Our purpose is to foster a passion for chemistry and its many subtopics. Typically, we are responsible for organizing chemistry tutors and hosting reviews before chemistry tests, midterms, and finals across all grades. We also organize students who wish to participate in Chemistry Olympiad. Although we struggled with participation in our first year, this second year has brought a huge increase in participation.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I joined Chemistry Club in its inaugural year last school year. It was started by a then-senior named Nick Carr who I knew from Science Olympiad. Although I didn't attend the test reviews, I did try to participate in Chemistry Olympiad with a few friends. Every week, we would meet with Nick and one of the chemistry teachers to go over past tests and learn the material we had yet to learn in our normal curriculum. Sadly, COVID-19 disrupted our lives right before we were supposed to take the local exam, and it was subsequently cancelled. Nearing the end of the school year, I applied to be one of four club board members, a spot which I received and currently serve as.

        This year, we've been trying to increase interest and participation in the club. The issue with last year was that a lot of people didn't hear about the club, so very few went to the test reviews. In order to improve this, we started collaborating with the chemistry teachers themselves to help us keep the chemistry students informed of our reviews. It's worked well, and participation in said reviews has gone up from around 3 people each time to close to 30. Additionally, since Chemistry Olympiad is going online this year, we've been holding preparation sessions for those. We did have a little trouble organizing the club at first, especially with figuring out how to run the club online, but I think we've settled on a very good system.
