      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       One of the many clubs that our school has is Chemistry Club. Our purpose is to foster a passion for chemistry and its many subtopics. Typically, we are responsible for organizing chemistry tutors and hosting reviews before chemistry tests, midterms, and finals across all grades. We also organize students who wish to participate in Chemistry Olympiad. Although we struggled with participation in our first year, this second year has brought a huge increase in participation.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I joined Chemistry Club in its inaugural year my sophomore year (2019-2020). It was started by a then-senior named Nick Carr who I knew from Science Olympiad. Although I didn't attend the test reviews offered, I did try to participate in Chemistry Olympiad with a few friends. Every week, we would meet with Nick and one of the chemistry teachers to go over past tests and learn the material we had yet to learn in our normal curriculum. Sadly, COVID-19 disrupted our lives right before we were supposed to take the local exam, and it was subsequently cancelled. Nearing the end of the school year, I applied to be one of four club board members, a spot which I received and currently serve as. 
        <br><br>
        Last year (2020-2021), our main goals were to increase interest and participation in the club. The issue with the previous year was that a lot of people didn't hear about the club, so very few went to the test reviews. In order to improve this, we started collaborating with the chemistry teachers themselves to help us keep the chemistry students informed of our reviews. It worked well, and participation in said reviews went gone up from around 3 people each time to close to 30. Additionally, since Chemistry Olympiad went online last year, we held preparation sessions for those. Although we did have a little trouble organizing the club at first, especially with specifics about running the club online, I think we settled on a very good system. 
        <br><br>
        This year I am again serving as a club board member, and our main goal for this year is to transition into in-person meetings while retaining our participation from last year. We also wanted to be better at communicating with teachers than last year, since a lack of communication on both sides made us miss a couple tests that sophomore chemistry students had. So far, these goals have been well-fulfilled by our meetings thus far. We've been able to host reviews for all the chemistry tests that have occurred this year and our in-person participation has held steady with our numbers from last year. Additionally, we've been getting some more kudos from people who tell us they would not have been able to complete a certain test without the review session, which I know myself and the other board members appreciate. Hopefully, we can maintain our clean record (of no missed tests) for the rest of the year.
