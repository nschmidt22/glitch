      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       For a couple of weeks in middle school, the place where I go to paint and draw
        was hosting an Arduino class where some of the kids who worked in the art studio
        could attend. I decided to go since I had an interest in programming and thought 
        that it would be fun. We learned how to code with javascript and how to properly
        set up code for our programs. We ended with coding a grid of LEDs to do different
        tasks.

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        This class was one of my first structured experiences in learning code. Before 
        then, most of what I did was helping my Dad with his projects or messing with
        coding on my own.
