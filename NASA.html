        The STEM Enhancement in Earth Science (SEES) summer internship program is a program sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium that allows provides a pathway for high school students to participate in NASA research as interns. Students are split into a variety of groups based on their interest and skill level, where they expand their knowledge on a given topic and explore the real-world applications and cutting-edge advancements of that topic. The internship lasts from late in the school year (around early May) and lasts until early August. While students are typically housed in Texas at the dorms of University of Austin Texas, the past two years have been virtually facilitated due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I was accepted into the group "GLOBE Observer Earth System Explorers", and we focused on analysis of land cover data and how that can specifically be applied to mosquito populations and their movement throughout the world. We collected and analyzed land cover data in our own area, conducted experiments concerning the factors that impact mosquito gestation, and formed smaller groups in which we wrote our own research papers. For more information about the paper that my smaller group wrote, see below. Throughout the internship, I was grateful that I had gotten accepted, as it was a wonderful experience that helped me learn more about the wide scope that NASA covers, where my own personal interests lie in the realm of science (for example, I found that I prefer researching to field work), and met a lot of people who shared my same interests.

        My group was comprised of 8 people (including myself): Anna Ager, Corbin Adkins, Michelle Eno, Benito Esposti, Andrew Kim, Justin Lan, and Felipe Solorzano. Our paper is about different kinds of biosensors and the kinds of areas that they are best suited for. Since our larger group within the internship had a strong focus on flaviviridae and their transmission through mosquitoes, we decided to focus on the transmission and detection of flaviviridae. To find areas where mosquito populations were dense and the types of landcover they thrived in, we analyzed landcover data from the SEES 2019-2021 Data Set, which included almost 4000 observations. This data was compiled to find hotspots in mosquito populations by three main genera that transmit disease, which was then layered on top of landcover and population maps. Since SEES interns are required to be US citizens, our research was limited to the US. In order to determine which biosensors would be best for these environments, we researched two main ones: fluorescent and waveguide-based biosensors. Looking at the strengths and weaknesses of each, we found that each had characteristics that made them optimal for different environments based on factors like population density, cost, and speed of detection. To learn more, read our paper (linked above). Below is the abstract for our paper: 
      <br><br>
      Efficient diagnostics have the potential to subside epidemics and global mortality rates- particularly in the context of Flaviviridae, a family of deadly, vector-borne viruses spread by mosquitoes. Current biosensors being used to detect the presence of Flaviviridae require two components: a biological component such as a protein, and a technological component to create a measurable signal. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensors effectively diagnose Flaviviridae from the point of care using quick, portable methods; however, these tools cannot diagnose a specific disease due to the structural similarities within Flaviviridae. They are also more economical due to their materials not being single-use as opposed to fluorescence-based devices. Fluorescence-based devices are accurate, however, the requirements of this method reduce its portability and increase potential costs. We hypothesized that either SPR or fluorescence contrast methods are more optimal in determining the presence of Flaviviridae, depending on SEES data patterns from the GLOBE Observer app. Based on data observations, we predict that implementing fluorescence-based biosensors in densely populated urban areas will be more efficient, as this biosensing method is more accurate at determining a specific disease within a large population, and do not require the flexibility and portability of SPR-based biosensors.
