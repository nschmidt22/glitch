      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       Our school offers a large variety of opportunities for students to tutor other students. Typically, these are organized by various clubs, which match with the subjects that they organize tutors for. One such club is our Physics Honors Society. They primarily help to provide resources from which students can study and, as previously mentioned, help students find tutors. Although they do not always appear active, they are an integral part to helping students who need help in their physics classes to find the assistance that they require.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I am one of the various tutors that helps younger students with their coursework. Currently, I tutor two students: Teodoro Gammons and Sidra Rasheed. Typically, I meet them individually when they let me know that they're struggling and we go over the problems that are troubling them. It's a good system, and its worked fairly well so far. I'm glad that I'm able to help them; I know that our school isn't the easiest and that the curriculum can be difficult. I look forward to continue helping others in their academic endeavors.
