      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       My school offers many enrichments available for students to take, as all students are required
        to have completed at least 6 enrichments by the end of their senior year. While it is possible
        to do independent and self-designed enrichments, this activity is one of the official ones
        provided by the school. It's purpose is to introduce students to HTML, CSS, and general concepts
        of building a website from scratch. Despite having already learned some HTML and CSS in the past,
        I had been focusing on other languages and wanted to make sure I remembered how to create websites.
