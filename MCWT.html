       The MCWT is the Michigan Council of Women in Technology. They host a wide variety of events that
        aim to introduce people, namely women and girls, to computing and other aspects of technology.
        I'd originally heard about them through my father, who knew a few people that were involved in 
        their Website Design Competition. While I wasn't old enough to participate in that event at the
        time, I was still interested in learning how to program a website. This was my first experience 
        with HTML and CSS.

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I attended the camp they held at the Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Michigan.
        If I remember correctly, I think this was between 5th and 6th grade, making it somewhere around
        2015 or 2016. I didn't know anything about HTML before the camp, so I was worried that I would 
        feel behind everyone else at the camp. However, once we started, I found that most of the other
        students were in the same boat as myself, and that I was not alone in my inexperience. It was 
        a great environment to start learning a new programming language.
