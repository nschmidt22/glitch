      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       One weekend of my sophomore year, I participated in a GEECS coding camp that was held at the
        University of Michigan. The purpose of the session was to teach a group of girls about 
        introductory Javascript by guiding us through the programming of a 'home-made' version of 
        an old mobile game: Flappy Bird.

      <h2>My experience</h2>
      <p>
        Although I had past experience in Javascript, I had not had time to practice it to make sure that
        I had retained that skill, so I felt that attending a beginning-level course would remind me and 
        jog my memory about the basics of Javascript. This event also provided me with the opportunity to 
        meet other girls interested in programming, a few of which I still keep in contact with today.
