      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        One of the many after-school activities that my school provides is Full Orchestra. It is an oppportunity offered to students who play an instrument that would like to expand their skills. Unlike the Orchestra class, Full Orchestra has a combination of both wind, string, and percussion players. Most of the string players are the same as those that play in the Symphony Orchestra class, while the wind players tend to be recommended by the band teacher to the orchestra teacher, or have auditioned to join. The repertoire is that of a typical orchestra, although there are times we perform arrangements of movie scores.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I started playing flute in my junior year. I decided not to continue doing Oakland Youth Orchestra because I didn't quite enjoy the way that they were structuring their virtual practices. Also, Oakland Youth Orchestra is a bigger time commitment than Full Orchestra, and with my junior approaching when I made the decision to switch, I knew that I wanted to be able to continue focusing on my education and maintaining my GPA.

        It has been interesting to figure out how we would run Full Orchestra with the current challenges of COVID-19 and virtual learning. For the most part, we've been playing pieces with backing tracks and doing check-ins with the conductor about once a month. As of late, the music department has begun to plan a virtual concert, so we are preparing a piece for that right now. I'm excited to see how it comes out. Even if it isn't the best, we'll be able to learn from the experience and see how we can improve for next time.
