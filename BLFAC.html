        Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp is a 12-day residential summer camp that provides 
        an opportunity for young musicians (Grades 5-12) to improve their various
        musical abilities (technique, tone, etc) with peers at the same skill level
        as themselves as they make new friends in their cabin and unit. For more details
        about the camp itself, please see the link above.

      <h2>First Year</h2>
      <p>
        I first attended Blue Lake in the summer between 5th and 6th grade. I was in 
        Camp Bernstein, the designated "younger student" group, but I was still the 
        youngest in my cabin and the flute section. Unlike the Central Camp, Bernstein
        doesn't separate musicians by skill, so everyone plays in the same band, 
        orchestra, choir, etc. Throughout camp that year, I felt I wasn't necessarily 
        challenged by the repertoire; Yes, I struggled with certain sections, but those
        were quickly brought up to the same level as the rest through our frequent 
        rehearsals. At the end of the session, I decided to go to Central Camp the following
        year. 
      </p>
      <h2>Second Year</h2>
      <p>
        My second year at Blue Lake was my first time auditioning for anything music related.
        I can't exactly remember how I did, but I do remember being very nervous and shaking 
        before heading into the room. Unlike Bernstein, Central Camp campers audition to be
        placed in one of a few ensembles of different levels. The "lowest" are the color bands:
        Blue Band and White Band. Then, it's Symphonic Band, followed by Wind
        Ensemble. If you are one of the best players of your instrument in your session, 
        you can choose to get placed in one of the Orchestras. My first year at Central Camp, I 
        got first chair in Blue Band. I was really excited to have gotten first chair and managed 
        to maintain my chair in re-audtions (they occur half a week after Opening Day to ensure 
        everyone is where they should really be). That session, I think I improved a lot and 
        learned some new ways to practice efficiently. 
      </p>
      <h2>Third Year</h2>
      <p>
        My third year at Blue Lake I got into the Symphonic Band. I was excited because it meant 
        that I was improving every year I went. This year was one of the years at Blue Lake that I felt
        the music I was playing was challenging the skills that I was developing on flute. I 
        think that because of this, I had to practice more during breaks and outside of our designated
        playing time, but it also helped me to continue growing as a flautist. Also, the more I 
        practiced outside of rehearsal, the more I interacted with other people in my unit, as those 
        were the people who heard me practice. Overall, I think this year at Blue Lake helped me to 
        become better at practicing flute efficiently and grow more comfortable with playing in front
        of other people. 
      </p>
      <h2>Fourth Year</h2>
      <p>
        My fourth year at Blue Lake, I was able to make it into Wind Ensemble. While I had initially
        auditioned into last chair of 9 or 12 people, I was still really excited about getting into the
        highest level band at the camp. Being last chair made me really motivated to properly prepare for
        reauditions, which allow sectional teachers to make sure that everyone was truly in the correct
        spot for chair placements. Even though it was my first time in Wind Ensemble, there were still
        some other flautists that I had known from the previous year in Symphonic Band. While we were 
        friendly, we also knew some of each others strengths and weaknesses, which emphasized the 
        competitive nature of reauditions. Despite this, I was still able to bump myself up to 5th chair. 
        This year I learned about a lot of new, efficient ways of practicing and playing. I also improved
        my extended flute techniques, such as beat boxing and singing while playing. 
      </p>
      <h2>Fifth Year</h2>
      <p>
        My fifth and final year at Blue Lake, I made it into Wind Ensemble again. Despite not moving up in
        ensembles, I wasn't disappointed because I made it into 3rd chair. I understood how difficult it 
        was and is to get into orchestras, and I wasn't the most serious player nor the oldest, so it made
        sense to me why I stayed in my ensemble from the previous year. The main difference between this 
        year and previous ones was that I learned how to do collaborative practicing. I had a surprising 
        number of my fellow Wind Ensemble flautists in the same unit, so we often had group practices in 
        which we shared effective strategies, alternate fingerings, and just generally helped one another 
        out. I was used to practicing alone, and the change was a helpful experience that taught me a lot 
        of skills to improve my playing. In general, I'd say that my final year at Blue Lake, despite being
        the last of many, still taught me much about myself and about my instrument.
