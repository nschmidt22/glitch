      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        One of the various after-school activities that my school provides is Jazz Band. It is run by 
        the band and choir teacher, and includes the main Jazz Band instruments (piano, drum set, 
        bass, guitar, various saxophones, trumpet, trombone, etc.). Typically, Jazz Band (affectionately
        known as Bazz Jand) meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2:45 to 3:30. Although we are typically 
        a smaller group, we still have fun learning and performing various jazz tunes from a variety of 
        subgenres.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I've played the piano for Jazz Band since my freshman year. One of the main reasons I knew about it
        and joined was because my sister had been the previous Jazz Band pianist in her sophomore, junior, 
        and senior years. Jazz Band has been a learning experience for me because I am a classically trained
        pianist, and I had no experience in any era outside of the Baroque, Classical, or Romantic periods
        before joining Jazz Band. I've learned much more about the importance of various chords and chord
        progressions as well as how to read jazz music written for piano. While I am still uncomfortable with
        improvisation, I hope that I am able to get comfortable with that by the end of my senior year.
