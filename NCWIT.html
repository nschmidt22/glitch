       Every year, the National Center for Women and Information Technology awards an accomplished group of girls, female-identifying, non-binary high schoolers with the Aspirations in Computing Award. Its purpose is to encourage future pursuits in computer science and information technology. According to their website, "Award recipients are selected based on their aptitude and aspirations in technology and computing, as demonstrated by their computing experience, computing-related activities, leadership experience, tenacity in the face of barriers to access, and plans for post-secondary education." There is a large variety of awards that they bestow, including: National Award Winner, National Honorable Mention, National Certificate of Distinction, Regional Affiliate Award Winner, Regional Affiliate Honorable Mention, and Regional Affiliate Rising Star.

      <h2>My Award</h2>
      <p>
        I received a 2021 Michigan Affiliate Honorable Mention. I was really excited when I learned of my achievement, and I made sure to do all that I needed to accept my award. Although I would have liked to be a Regional Affiliate Award Winner, I'm still really happy with the honorable mention I received. This is definitely going to help to motivate me in my future computational experiences. I've never received an award for computer experience before now, and since I haven't had any formal education in the topic, I'm really proud of myself. I hope I can continue working in this field and gaining more experience. Wish me luck!
