      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       Last year, my friend Hope Techlin and I started this club to help our peers with their physics coursework. Early in the year, we noticed that a lot of students struggled with physics, especially when we looked at test averages (some were as low as 39% and most needed to be curved). As a result, we decided to start the "Junior Physics Help" Club to hold weekly meetings where peers could stop by anytime within an hour to ask questions they had about homework or about content we covered in class. This year, we decided to continue running it and decided to make it similar to <a href="Chem.html">Chemistry Club</a>, where we have slides for every unit and hold consistent reviews before tests.

        As stated above, I'm one of the founders of the club. Because of this, I also tended to answer many of the questions that were asked. Since we started the club in second semester of last year, there were only so many topics that we were able to help with. However, I think we did a fairly decent job, since the first assessment after the club began had an average score of 89, one of the highest that year. I also created a slides presentation that summarized all of our content from each respective unit, including formulas and conceptual knowledge we needed to know. 
        <br><br>
        This year we've been doing a pretty good job expanding the club to grades outside of our own. While we did want to make the club a little more like Chemistry Club, we decided to maintain the weekly meetings that we have for any general questions people may have between test reviews. While it does take more time, I think these meetings are good for Physics Club because they help the teachers a lot, especially the ones that teach the younger students. They allow people who need help to find the resources they need and it seems to help them better understand the content, which helps teachers and students alike. We have continued to post presentations reviewing test content and still hold test reviews, which always seems to help clear up last minute confusion and concepts. Finally, we're also responsible for pairing people who request a single tutor with an older student who can help them. I get an email every time someone fills out the "Tutor Request Form" and I pair them with someone who has filled out the "Tutor Signup Form". I also keep track of who has how many students and make sure that people are informed before they receive more than one student. This system has been working fairly well, and as we have had minimal issues, we plan to continue using it through next year.
