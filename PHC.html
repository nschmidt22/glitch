      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       This year, my friend Hope Techlin and I started this club to help our peers with their physics coursework. Throughout the year, we noticed that a lot of students struggled with physics, especially when we looked at test averages (some were as low as 39% and most needed to be curved). As a result, we decided to start the "Junior Physics Help" Club to hold weekly meetings where peers could stop by anytime within an hour to ask questions they had about homework or about content we covered in class. We hope to continue running the club next year and making it similar to <a href="Chem.html">Chemistry Club</a>, where we have slides for every unit and hold consistent reviews before tests.

        As stated above, I'm one of the founders of the club. Because of this, I also tended to answer many of the questions that were asked. Since we started the club in second semester of this year, there were only so many topics that we were able to help with. However, I think we did a fairly decent job, since the first assessment after the club began had an average score of 89, one of the highest this year. I also created a slides presentation that summarized all of our content from each respective unit, including formulas and conceptual knowledge we needed to know.
