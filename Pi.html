      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       When I was 8, my father got me my first computer: a Raspberry Pi. At the time, I didn't know much about its capabilities, 
        but I did know that I could use it to program easy programs with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> and play games that were already pre-made. This Raspberry Pi was my first independent experience in programming, and I think that I could have advanced more if I was in a more structured environment, but I still enjoyed it.
