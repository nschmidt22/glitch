        Science Olympiad is a nation-wide series of STEM-related competitions that work to advance and 
        foster an interest in students of all ages. Every division has different events, which include
        build, test, and experimental events. From astronomy to gravity vehicle, there are many topics
        that are covered spanning the entire field of STEM.

   <!-- Freshman Year -->
    <div>
      <h2>Freshman Year</h2>
      <p>
        I decided to do Science Olympiad in my freshman year because I felt that it would be better 
        suited to my personal needs than robotics. I would have been more interested in continuing 
        with robotics, but it didn't take place at the school, I likely wouldn't be able to carpool,
        and there was a time requirement for lab hours. I felt that Science Olympiad would be a better
        option that would still allow me to further my interests in STEM. I was really nervous, because
        at our school, everyone who wants to be on the team must take tryout tests that determine who 
        gets on the team and if they make it onto JV or Varsity. I knew that there weren't too many other
        freshman trying out and that I had the least experience in the topics that would be tested, so I 
        worked really hard to make sure my 'cheat sheets' (you are allowed one one-sided sheet per test) 
        were top-notch. I ended up making it onto the JV team, and my events were astronomy, experimental 
        design, and protein modeling. We did ok in competitions, but communication between the JV and Varsity
        teams wasn't the best and we were scored against every schools varsity teams along with their JV
        teams. In regionals, JV teams and Varsity teams are scored seperately, and my partners and I received
        second place for experimental design and protein modeling. Astronomy tends to be very competitive, so 
        I wasn't too disappointed with that one. JV teams don't compete past regionals, so my seasons ended 
        there. 
      </p>

    <!-- Sophomore Year -->
    <div>
      <h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
      <p>
        In my sophomore year, I strongly hoped that I would make it onto the Varsity team. Being on the JV
        team had been fun and had less responsibilities, but I wanted to push myself and actually help our
        team in our effort to get to states and nationals. I studied for tryouts again, both taking some of
        the notes from my previous tryout tests and notes from the previous season, but also adding new 
        information from the internet. I managed to make it onto Varsity, and my events were astronomy,
        protein modeling, and detector building. I was excited to have astronomy and protein modeling again,
        especially because I had done them before, and was interested in participating in a new event (last 
        year was the first year they did detector building). Competitions went fairly well, and I enjoyed 
        helping the JV parallels of my events. In regionals, my partners and I got seventh place for astronomy
        and protein modeling. I was really excited for the astronomy placement because it's a really 
        competitive event and I knew that a lot of people worked really hard on that event. Sadly, states
        and nationals were canceled due to COVID-19, but I hope that we qualify this year (2020-2021 school year).

    <!-- Junior Year -->
    <div>
      <h2>Junior Year</h2>
      <p>
        I'm hoping to keep my spot on the Varsity team and continue with some previous events and some new events. 
        We haven't taken the tryout tests yet, but I have prepared most of my note sheets and I'm feeling more
        confident than I have in previous years. I'm hoping to get astronomy, protein modeling, and a new event. 
        While I enjoyed detector building, there was some issues in proctoring (mainly because it's a new event)
        and I don't know how they'll be doing build events this year. Wish me luck!
      </p>

      <h2>Descriptions of My Events</h2>
      <p>
        Astronomy: In Astronomy, students are asked to know about many aspects of astronomy, from general concepts,
        to mathematics, to specific celestial bodies. It is a competitive event that requires a lot of knowledge, 
        which is why this is the only event in which students may have their notes on a computer and the binders
        that they can use have no size limit. Computers must have wifi turned off during tests, and proctors are 
        often instructed to check to make sure everyone is following this rule. 
        <br><br>
        Protein Modeling: This event is a mix of a test event and a build event. The build part requires students to 
        contruct a model of a specified protein (changes annually). The test version typically covers topics related
        to the protein that students are modeling and other general information on proteins and how they affect the
        body. Tests also require students to view a different protein model in an online 3D environment called JSMOL 
        and answer questions related to this new model. For tests, students are allowed one double-sided sheet of paper. 
        <br><br>
        Experimental Design: Students are given a set amount of time to design, conduct, and asses an experiment using
        materials and a topic provided at competitions. Since it changes every competition, the students are mostly 
        being assessed on their ability to properly follow the scientific method in varying experiments in different 
        subjects. Topics have ranged frmo chemistry to physics, friction to acid/base reactions. Students are only 
        allowed pencils, erasers, calculators, and safety goggles during tests. 
        <br><br>
        Detector Building: In Detector Building, students must create a device that detects the temperature of water 
        by running a current through it and assessing the output to find the water's temperature. Microcontrollers, 
        TI-84 calculators, and many other such computers can be used. My partner and I used an Arduino Uno R3 because
        I had one available at home. There is also a test portion that assesses students on concepts of electricity
        and diodes.
