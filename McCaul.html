      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       The McCaul Fund is a grant given to a student or a group of students to further their participation
        in the STEM field over the summer. It is unique to my middle school, and was awarded to myself and 
        two other friends for the summer between our 7th and 8th grade years.

      <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        We were awarded the grant to advance our knowledge and understanding of drones, how they work, and 
        how we would design one of our own. We used the grant money to buy various types of drones, mostly
        focusing on smaller ones that would be cheaper and easier to take apart and evaluate. Below are 
        a few pictures of some of the drones we bought, including one that we completely took apart and 
        looked at closely. When we were thinking of what we were looking for in a drone of our own, we 
        noticed that many of the drones presented safety hazards due to the propellers. Our theoretical
        design involved a drone that had an outer casing to protect any hands that might try to interfere
        with the propellers motion. It would be either plastic or aluminum (light-weight) and would 
        completely surround the drone in a semi-spherical shape. While we never actually created it, we
        made a few prototypes. This project developed our critical thinking and helped us to learn much 
        more about drones than just observation or research would.
