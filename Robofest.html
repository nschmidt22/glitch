       In 2018, I participated in the Robofest hosted by Lawrence Technological University. It was sponsored by the Institute of Electrical
        and Electronics Engineers, and featured competitors from all over Southeast Michigan. Most of the robots were built from VEX IQ parts
        and were designed to perform various tasks, such as Robo Arts, Bottle Sumo, and the Unknown Mission Challenge.

        This is a Youtube video that shows the participants of Robofest from 2018. I appear at 1:10; I am the second person from the

       I participated in the Bottle Sumo challenge, where robots are supposed to push a bottle or a number of bottles off of a table.
        Typically, the bottles are in variosu standard locations for every competition, and students are meant to reprogram the robot for         each setup. I had already worked with the VEX IQ pieces as those were the same pieces I had used at VEX IQ robotics competitions 
        earlier in the year, so I was able to continue working with familiar building techniques, programming, and designs. However, for 
        this event, I was able to work with people different from my normal robotics team, so it was nice to meet 
        more people at school who were interested in robotics. I also learned about how robotics competitions outside of VEX IQ were run, 
        with most variations being in set-up, impound, and other technicalities. I also learned more about other ways to build robots, 
        such as with Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, etc.
