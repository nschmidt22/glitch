        Cubes in Space is a competition that allows students ages 11-18 the 
        opportunity to conduct experiments involving conditions on the outer
        edges of Earth's atmosphere. The main limitation is that it must fit inside
        a 4 cm^3 cube.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I participated in Cubes in Space during Eigth grade with a group of peers. 
        My role in the group was head tech (our experiment involved computers)
        and assembler (meaning that I helped to assemble the experiment in the cube). 
        I also played a major role in explaining how the experiment worked in our proposal.

      <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://cdn.glitch.com/aff0e7cc-a956-4c83-8560-205732c7e075%2FTeam%202%20Proposal%20Final.pdf?v=1596483773306">Official Proposal Pdf</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        My group's project was in connection to a separate experiment our teacher
        had involved the classroom in. They had been monitoring the growth of several
        Arabidopsis Thaliana plants on the ISS and on Earth to see the effects of 
        low gravity on their growth. However, the project was negatively impacted when
        all of the plants on the ISS had died due to an excess of heat in the room they
        were being stored in. Although there had been a fan that was meant to keep them
        cool, the sound it made while running exceeded the restrictions that the ISS has.
        Our project was to see if we could make small Arduino-run fans that could go inside
        the container that the plants themselves were in. We wanted to use Cubes in Space
        to see how the environment would effect the computer components if they weren't protected
        much.
