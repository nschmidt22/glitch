        Oakland Youth Orchestra is a group of ensembles for young people interested in participating in 
        out-of-school orchestras. Whether it is because they want more experience with orchestral repertoire
        or their school doesn't have an orchestra, OYO provides an option for students to further themselves 
        in their musical experience.

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I participated in OYO during my freshman and sophomore years of high school. For both years, I was in 
        Philharmonic Orchestral group and learned a lot about orchestral playing. This was my first experience 
        playing in an orchestra, which I learned was quite different from playing in other ensembles like band.
        In orchestra, wind parts are much more exposed and everyone needs to work harder to stay together and 
        figure out who gets what solos in which pieces. I learned much more about sectional collaboration and 
        how to negotiate solos. Skills that I generally improved on were scales, arpeggios, and the fluiditiy 
        of my upper register. I would have continued to do OYO, but I preferred the way my school's orchestra
        was planning on running virtually, so I decided to switch.
