      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       Math lab is the primary math tutoring club at my school. It holds daily meetings for students who need help with their math homework or content. Only juniors and seniors are allowed to tutor, and there are usually 3-5 tutors in the room at a time. In a typical year, we use one of the conference rooms and people stay in the rooms on their respective tutoring days. However, due to the online format of this year, we typically hosted a Zoom call where people could join anytime within the allotted hour to ask questions they had.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        Since only juniors and seniors participated, this was my first year as a tutor. I was a tutor on Mondays, and often had a similar group of people that would come for help. Most of them were sophomores and freshman, so I didn't encounter too many issues with not knowing the content they were covering. Overall, I think it was a great way for me to review older content from previous years while helping out younger students with difficult aspects of the subject. At the end of this past school year (2020-2021), I was selected as a board member for Math Lab for next year. I'm excited to help organize tutors for next year, and I hope to increase participation among upperclassmen since we were often short on tutors.
