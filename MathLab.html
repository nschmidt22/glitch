      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       Math lab is the primary math tutoring club at my school. It holds daily meetings for students who need help with their math homework or content. Only juniors and seniors are allowed to tutor, and there are usually 3-5 tutors in the room at a time. In a typical year, we use one of the conference rooms and people stay in the rooms on their respective tutoring days. Last year, however, we switched to an online format due to COVID-19. Typically, we would have a Zoom call running for an hour or two where people could join to get their questions answered.  This year, we have decided to do a hybrid format for at least the first semester, where Mondays and Wednesdays are online on a Google Meet and Tuesdays and Thursdays are in person in one of the math classrooms and the conference room we used to use before the pandemic.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        Since only juniors and seniors participate, last year was my first year as a tutor. I was a tutor on Mondays, and often had a similar group of people that would come for help. Most of them were sophomores and freshman, so I didn't encounter too many issues with not knowing the content they were covering. Overall, I think it was a great way for me to review older content from previous years while helping out younger students with difficult aspects of the subject. At the end of last school year (2020-2021), I was selected as a board member for Math Lab for this year. 
        <br><br>
        So far, in terms of leading the club, everything has been running smoothly. The other board members and myself have been able to work out a schedule that seems to work well for everyone, especially with the hybrid format we decided to go with. I have been primarily responsible for making sure people who need tutors are paired with older students that can help them. I have it set up so that I get an email whenever a student fills out the "Tutor Request Form" and I pick someone from our tutor list who can help them. We also keep track of how many people each tutor has and try to check in to see if they have time for another student before we assign them another tutee. It's been a fairly efficient and productive system, so I'm glad everything has been running smoothly.
