      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       One of the many honors societies that our school has is Spanish Honors Society. It is a club available to students who take Spanish and are looking to expand their participation in the topic. There is a grade minimum, and students must answer three short answer questions in spanish in order to apply. They organize tutoring for spanish students in younger grades and also host preparation sessions for oral exams for older students. They often hold culture events, which range from making Spanish cookies to celebrating holidays from Spanish-speaking countries.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I joined SHS at the start of my second semester of junior year. Last year, I enjoyed the more in-depth explorations into Spanish culture and its many nuances. I am always fascinated with how different cultures act and what their respective norms are, so it was nice to learn more. Last year, I participated in some of the Spanish tutoring that is part of the requirements for being inducted into the club. I think it was a great experience because it helped me to improve my own Spanish skills as well as those of the person I was tutoring.
        <br><br>
        This year, I plan to continue tutoring and participating in more of the cultural events. Last year, we had been limited to events we could only do virtually, such as watching a video about something instead of actively participating in a related activity. Since it looks like we'll be able to do more interactive and involved cultural activities this year, I'm excited to see what the club's leaders have planned!
