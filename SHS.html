      <p>
       One of the many honors societies that our school has is Spanish Honors Society. It is a club available to students who take Spanish and are looking to expand their participation in the topic. There is a grade minimum, and students must answer three short answer questions in spanish in order to apply. They organize tutoring for spanish students in younger grades and also host preparation sessions for oral exams for older students. They often hold culture events, which range from making Spanish cookies to celebrating holidays from Spanish-speaking countries.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I joined SHS at the start of my second semester of junior year. So far, I've enjoyed the more in-depth explorations into Spanish culture and its many nuances. I am always fascinated with how different cultures act and what their respective norms are, so I've greatly enjoyed the opportunity to learn more. Although I have yet to do so, I look forward to tutoring students in Spanish, as tutoring hours are a requirement to be inducted. I think it will help me to improve my own Spanish skills as well as those of the person I'm tutoring, so I'm excited to see how that goes.
