       Over the summer, Girls Who Code typically hosts a Summer Immersion Program for girls interested in 
        learning about programming. This year it was online, which is what allowed me to participate (as it 
        is usually held on the East coast). The focus was to teach us about website design and programming
        with HTML, CSS, and javascript through two projects: a personal website and a buzzfeed-style quiz. 
        This website is actually a continuation of the personal website from the camp.

      <h2>My participation</h2>
      <p>
        I participated this past summer during quarantine, and had originally participated to refresh my HTML
        and CSS knowledge. I gained much more than that; I learned about programming concepts that I had not
        yet learned, found a new community that I was a part of, and learned more about making interactive websites,
        which I had never done before. It was a great experience that pleasantly surprised me with information I had
        not yet learned despite my history in programming.
