       The Oakland Game and Invention Challenge held its first year in early 2020 (before quarantine). Its aim was to 
        encourage students to showcase their game ideas and inventions among other innovators in their age range. The
        range of possibilities was endless and kept as open as possible in order to encourage participation. Game types
        ranged from board games to video games, and some covered issues such as bullying or encouraged leadership. Inventions
        also had a wide variety, and issues they addressed ranged from salting Michigan roads to help the elderly walk with 
        better shoes.

      <h2>My Invention</h2>
      <p>
        I decided to participate in the invention portion of the challenge. My invention was a portable, automated hydroponics system. 
        It was designed to solve issues that may arise in long term space travel, growing plants in hostile environments, and growing
        plants at home. Technically, it was the same system that I had created for my personal project, but I thought about it in 
        different ways and focused on different aspects of the project in this event than I did for my Personal Project Essay. I did 
        not win any awards, but I still enjoyed and value the experience.
