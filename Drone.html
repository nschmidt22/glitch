      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       This workshop was actually an award I received as part of a group I was in for the 
        <a href="Startup.html">Detroit Startup Weekend</a> activity that I participated in. 
        I forget which reward we received, but I do remember that the prize was the ability 
        to attend this build your own drone workshop for free.

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I had a great experience at this workshop. It was actually one of my first times working
        with the hardware aspect of electronics, so I learned a lot. I think this was my first time
        sautering, so I did accidentally touch the iron a few times, but I didn't burn myself too bad.
        In the end, I had a working drone to show for a couple hours of assembly. See below for a few
        pictures of the drone that I built.
