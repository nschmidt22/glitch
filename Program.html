      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       Programming club is a student-led club available at my school. We aim to introduce and foster an 
        interest in programming and its many applications and facets. Events that we do include coding 
        introductions, guest speakers, and many others. Last year we focused on learning about what it
        takes to make a video game; while we would have made one ourselves, we realized that we would need
        a lot more people involved if we were to make one of quality. Still, it was a good experience in 
        learning how much work goes into such products. This year, we're focusing on teaching students 
        Python and its applications in deep learning, hopefully building ourselves to a point in which we 
        can compete in Kaggle Competitions in the future.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        Last year, my sophomore year, was my first year in programming club. It is one of the smaller clubs
        at our school, so I hadn't noticed it during my freshman year. An upperclassman that knew both me and my
        sister had been one of the board members for the club, knew I had an interest in coding, and invited me to join.
        I decided to go to the introductory meeting to see what it was all about, and attended every meeting that
        followed. Their focus was, as mentioned, creating a video game. I was on the creative and programming teams
        for the game, and worked with many upper classmen who were more experienced in programming than I was. 
        While I have been and still am more of a 'jack of all trades' kind of programmer, many of them had specific 
        areas of expertise. While we didn't finish, I still learned a lot about other programmers, programming in 
        general, and how much work it takes to make a good quality video game. 
        <br><br>
        At the end of my sophomore year (2019-2020), I also
        applied to be part of the board the following year (last year), and received the position of treasurer. While my
        official role stated that I was to handle the financial aspects of the club, we didn't have any money 
        involved, so I tended to help with some of the work that the president and vice president were doing. For first semester last year, we primarily 
        held weekly virtual meetings on Wednesdays at 3 or 3:30 where we taught attendees
        about Python, data structures, and the like. We had a smaller group last year than the previous year, but I think that
        that helps with attendance and the class-like structure we've developed. 
        <br><br>
        At the start of second semester last year, I started to teach an Intro to HTML class. We covered the basics of HTML, CSS, and some JS. Our first meeting had been on January 26th, 2021, and it had gone quite well; we actually had some of the most participants of all of our meetings that year. It was interesting teaching a class, since I didn't (and still don't) have much experience as a teacher, but I think I was able to get the hang of it. I asked friends who took the class for feedback, and they said that they enjoyed the pacing and visuals I provided. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rhU7eJBhQ3VDrmyM9TSyEFssWcR-8aG3JaDrj4mt_KQ/edit?usp=sharing">Here is a link to our first presentation. </a>
        <br> <br>
        Towards the end of last year, I was appointed the president of the club. My main plans were to continue the classes from the end of last year, try participating in some hackathons as a club, and do some app development, and I think we've gotten a good start into most of these goals. In October, we started doing the HTML presentations again, and those have been having a very positive response, similar to last year. We've also had a couple meetings for people interested in participating in hackathons, and it looks like we'll have enough people to get a decent sized team for any group hackathons we find. I had planned app development to be something we would work on later in the year, so I'm not too concerned that we haven't started that yet. However, one concern I'm beginning to have for this year is lack of gender diversity. Last year, we were able to have a fairly balanced group in terms of gender issues, but this year it is heavily dominated by male students. To gain more interest, I was thinking of doing a Girls Who Code meeting or finding a group for women in technology in the nearby area that would be willing to give a presentation. It'll be difficult to organize, but I think it would be worth it.
