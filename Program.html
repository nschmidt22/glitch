      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       Programming club is a student-led club available at my school. We aim to introduce and foster an 
        interest in programming and its many applications and facets. Events that we do include coding 
        introductions, guest speakers, and many others. Last year we focused on learning about what it
        takes to make a video game; while we would have made one ourselves, we realized that we would need
        a lot more people involved if we were to make one of quality. Still, it was a good experience in 
        learning how much work goes into such products. This year, we're focusing on teaching students 
        Python and its applications in deep learning, hopefully building ourselves to a point in which we 
        can compete in Kaggle Competitions in the future.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        Last year, my sophomore year, was my first year in programming club. It is one of the smaller clubs
        at our school, so I hadn't noticed it during my freshman year. An upperclassman that knew both me and my
        sister had been one of the board members for the club, knew I had an interest in coding, and invited me to join.
        I decided to go to the introductory meeting to see what it was all about, and attended every meeting that
        followed. Their focus was, as mentioned, creating a video game. I was on the creative and programming teams
        for the game, and worked with many upper classmen who were more experienced in programming than I was. 
        While I have been and still am more of a 'jack of all trades' kind of programmer, many of them had specific 
        areas of expertise. While we didn't finish, I still learned a lot about other programmers, programming in 
        general, and how much work it takes to make a good quality video game. 
        <br><br>
        At the end of last school year, I also
        applied to be part of the board the following year (this year), and received the position of treasurer. While my
        official role states that I am to handle the financial aspect of the club, we don't currently have any money 
        involved, so I've been helping with some of the work that the president and vice president are doing. We've 
        currently been holding weekly virtual meetings on Wednesdays at 3 or 3:30 where we've been teaching attendees
        about Python, data structures, and the like. We have a smaller group this year than last year, but I think that
        that helps with attendance and the class-like structure we've developed. 
        <br><br>
        Recently, at the start of second semester, I've started to teach an Intro to HTML class. We'll be covering the basics of HTML, CSS, and maybe some JS if we are able to maintain participation. Our first meeting was on January 26th, and it went quite well; we actually had some of the most participants of all of our meetings this year. It's interesting teaching a class, as I don't have much experience as a teacher, but I think I am beginning to get the hang of it. I've asked friends who are taking the class for feedback, and they said that they are enjoying the pacing and visuals I've been providing. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rhU7eJBhQ3VDrmyM9TSyEFssWcR-8aG3JaDrj4mt_KQ/edit?usp=sharing">Here is a link to our first presentation. </a>
