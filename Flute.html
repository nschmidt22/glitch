       At the end of my 3rd grade year, my school had all of the students try various instruments and see
        how each one felt and played. We went through the wind instruments with the band teacher, the
        string instrments with the orchestra teacher, and the percussion instruments with the percussion 
        instructor. On one of the last days of school, the music teachers came in and handed everyone a 
        sheet of paper with the instrument they recommended to us. I got the flute. 
        <br><br>
        For our elementary school, students typically (if they chose to) began band and orchestra in
        4th grade. We learned the basics and performed simple music as groups. We weren't exactly the 
        most proficient ensembles, but we did improve through 4th and 5th grade as we continued to play.
        I continued to play flute into middle and high school, even participating in Solo and Ensemble, 
        MSBOA Honors Band, and auditioning for All State. In middle school, I also placed second in the <a href="http://semfa2014.bravesites.com/competitions">Rachel Stornant Junior Artist Competition. </a>
        <br><br>
        In high school, I've played flute in a few orchestras and have continued to participate in my 
        schools band. For my freshamn and sophomore years, I participated in <a href="OYO.html">OYO</a>
        (see the linked webpage for more details). For my junior and senior year, I switched to 
        participating in my schools Full Orchestra due to my non-preference with the way OYO ran virtual rehearsals last year.

      <h2>Private Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        If I recall correctly, I believe I started private flute lessons in 5th grade. My older sister
        also played flute, so we had the same teacher. I still play with her today, and I believe that 
        I would not be as proficient in flute as I am today if I had taken lessons from any other teacher.
        She has pushed me and continues to push me to do my best and take hold of the opportunities
        presented to me in the flute aspect of my life.
