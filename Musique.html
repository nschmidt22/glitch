      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       Faire Musique is a group of students who go to senior homes and perform music. There is a wide
        range of instrments, from piano to saxophone to cello. The purpose of the group is to bring 
        live performances to seniors who may not otherwise have access to such activities. The group was
        started by a high school student and was passed down to another student. While we haven't been
        able to perform due to COVID-19 concerns, we hope to be able to get back to performing in the 
        future.

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I perform on both flute and piano at these performances. I tend to play whichever instrument has a 
        performance-ready piece that I can play with minimal mistakes. Faire Musique helps me overcame my 
        performance and social anxiety, as I often struggle with staying calm during performances and with 
        speaking about myself to strangers. After we perform, I tend to stay behind a little and help with
        handing out the refreshments that we usually bring. I always enjoy chatting with the audience 
        because they tend to be very kind and friendly.
