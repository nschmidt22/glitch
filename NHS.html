      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       In the spring of junior year, students with GPAs above 3.6 are invited to our school's National Honors Society. Students in NHS have the following responsibilities: maintain a GPA above 3.6 on a 4.0 scale, complete 10 hours of community service, assist with tutoring underclassmen, participate in the chapter project, and attend monthly meetings.

      <p>
        Since students are invited to join at the end of their junior years, I haven't been able to do much for NHS yet. Besides applying, I've been able to mark two of my club events (chemistry club tutoring and math lab) for NHS hours, and I'm hoping to do more next year. Overall, I'm looking forward to the opportunities this club will bring and I hope I can benefit my community through it.
