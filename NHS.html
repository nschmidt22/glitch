      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       In the spring of junior year, students with GPAs above 3.6 are invited to our school's National Honors Society. Students in NHS have the following responsibilities: maintain a GPA above 3.6 on a 4.0 scale, complete 10 hours of community service, assist with tutoring underclassmen, participate in the chapter project, and attend monthly meetings.

      <p>
        Since students are invited to join at the end of their junior years, I wasn't able to do much for NHS last year. Besides applying, I was able to mark two of my club events (chemistry club tutoring and math lab) for NHS hours, which was a fairly decent start. This year, we've started to promote NHS provided tutoring more and other NHS sponsored events. For example, for Halloween, we did a Trunk or Treat at the school and invited a number of kids from the surrounding neighborhoods. It worked pretty well and we had a fairly good turnout.
