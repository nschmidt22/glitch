        Detroit Youth Startup Weekend was a weekend in which teaches students what it means and what it takes to be 
        an entreprenuer. Students form groups based on an idea and design and build a company pitch that is presented.
        Awards are given out at the end, and one of the prizes is a <a href="Drone.html">Build Your Own Drone Workshop</a>.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I was the leader of my group, and our idea was to create safer drones. We wanted to create a type of drone that 
        modeled a snitch (enchanted object from the world of Harry Potter) and flew like a hummingbird. We studied the flight
        patterns of hummingbirds, like why they are the only bird that can fly backwards, and started prototyping and designing.
        Many of the people on our team were older than me, so it felt weird to lead them and make my idea come into fruition,
        but it helped me to develop my leadership skills and become more comfortable with communicating my ideas in groups. 
        In the end, our group won the <a href="Drone.html">Build Your Own Drone Workshop</a>, which we attended later that year.
