      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
       When I was around 4, my sister began taking drawing classes from one of our Mom's friends who 
        ran art classes from her basement. Once I was 5, I joined her. On Saturdays, we would go over 
        to her house and join the many other students who were learning art. While neither of us 
        were looking to do art as our occupation, we still enjoyed learning this useful skill. Our 
        teacher had an order of artistic areas that she had most of her students follow, including us.
        It started with animals made of simple shapes, which we drew with HB pencils and crayons. Then 
        more complex cartoon-style pictures, such as a subject with a background, but using colored pencils
        instead of crayons. Next would be either be 3D shapes and shading or colored pencil landscapes. After
        both of those units would be sketching busts that resembled the style of Greek statues. Many would 
        then start painting, which started with acrylic and then only occasionally advanced on to oil. At that
        point, many would then either continue with their preferred medium or already be old enough to be 
        heading to college.

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        When I began, I was one of her youngest students, and advanced at the normal rate. I followed the 
        order mentioned above fairly closely, and had a lot of fun learning various drawing and painting
        techniques. My sister left when she reached middle school, but I continued until my sophomore year
        of highschool. I didn't leave because of any reason in particular, it's just that the times that I 
        used to be available to go to drawing were now taken up by all-day-long competitions like robotics
        (in middle school) or Science Olympiad (high school). While I don't go to classes anymore, I still 
        enjoy drawing when I have the time to.
