      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       The Quarantine Online Science Tournament was hosted by the Indiana High School Science Championship
        on the weekend of July 31 - August 2. It was meant to encourage the continued participation in 
        STEM-related activities throughout quarantine, and was brought up to me through my school's Science
        Olympiad team.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        My events were astronomy, inorganic chemistry, and computer science. I had surprisingly been fairly
        busy around the time that it happened, so I didn't have much time to prepare, but we did alright 
        overall. I think that this event reminded me that despite how much I've learned about these topics,
        I still have a lot that I have yet to master.
