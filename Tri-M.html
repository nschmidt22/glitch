      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       Tri-M is the name of our school's music honors society. It is open to all grades and is meant to increase people's participation in music-related services, from helping organize the band room to performing for senior homes. In the past, we've also attended musicals as a group and hosted watch parties for music-related movies. Every year, we are required to complete 3 requirements: 1 service event, 1 performance event, and 1 extra (can be either service or performance).

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I joined in my freshman year and have been a member since. It was a great way for me to meet upperclassmen in my freshman and sophomore years, and it helped me to find opportunities to spread my love of music to my community. For example, throughout freshman year, I perforemd at a variety of senior homes and helped the school organize our music rooms. This year made it difficult to reach the service requirement, but the society did provide opportunities for us to complete these requirements despite our virtual format. For this, I was able to participate in a music tutoring session for the flute. One of the club's board members has a brother who is a boyscout, and we did a collaborative meeting where we helped to tutor the boyscouts who played our instrument in a Zoom call. It was an interesting and educative experience that I'm glad I was able to participate in.
