        MMSS is a group of camps that all aim to show high school students different applications and
        aspects of various STEM fields. They also show the students what part of their college 
        experience may be like if they attend the University of Michigan, as most of the camps involve
        using the extensive resources available to university students.

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        The specific camp that I attended was the Forensic Physics camp, taught by Mr. Ramon Torres-Isea
        of the Univeristy of Michigan Physics Department. We focused on the physics aspect of forensic
        science, and covered topics ranging from quantum physics to blood type determination. The camp
        was very fast-paced and I had a little bit of trouble keeping up with the physics portion, but
        I was still able to learn a lot in a short period of time. I was better at keeping up with the 
        forensic portion, and played a major role in our practice crime investigation. A few of the 
        activities we did include: crime scene investigation, bullet identification, blood splatter 
        analysis, learning about properties of particles/waves, wavelengths and their effects, and 
        watching a movie about the inadequacy of a lot of forensic departments nationwide.

        For part of our focus on forensics, we investigated fake crime scenes <br> and learned ways to use forensic physics to solve the case

        This is from when we were learning about light diffraction and how you <br> can create glasses that make light look light different shapes, like snowflakes.
