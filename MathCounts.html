        Throughout all of middle school, I participated in Mathcounts, where students would go to learn 
        about math concepts that either weren't covered in school or made us think about certain math
        problems with a different perspective. Every year, there would also be a math competition that 
        students who volunteered and passed the volunteer test (or were among the top few scores) would
        attend.

      <h2>My Participation</h2>
      <p>
        I attended after school and after school sports from 4 to 5pm. Many of my friends also 
        participated in Mathcounts, so we tended to collaborate on group problems and enjoy ourselves 
        more than if we'd been alone. In seventh grade, I was able to get a spot on the math competition
        team. See below for pictures from that event.
